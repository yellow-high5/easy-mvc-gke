Easy MVC Application for Google Kubernetes Engine
====

## What?
This Project is Easy Simple Application(Vue.js + Spring Boot + MySQL) on GKE.  
Kubernetes is container orchestration tool. GKE is a managed service that abstracts kubernetes so that even beginners of infrastructure can easily operate.  
It helps you understand the approach of building a basic application consisting of a web server, application server, and database in a container and deploying it to a GKE environment.  

## How to hands on

### Local Development
You have to install Docker and Docker Compose on your local computer.  
ðŸ‘‰You need checking Kubernets Engine API and Service Networking API is enabled  
cf. My Local Computer(MacBook Pro): Docker version 19.03.2, docker-compose version 1.24.1  
Maybe, it takes a long time to `mvn install` in build stage of Dockerfile.  

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/yellow-high5/easy-mvc-gke.git
$ docker-compose build
$ docker-compose up -d
```

### Google Kubernetes Engine
You need Google Cloud Platform Account.  
cf. My GKE Version: 1.13.11-gke.14  

```sh
# On your Google Cloud Shell
$ git clone https://github.com/yellow-high5/easy-mvc-gke.git
$ sh production-gke-exe.sh
$ kubectl create -f project-all-in-one.yml
```
