# Easy MVC Application for Google Kubernetes Engine

## What?

This Project is Easy Simple Application(Vue.js + Spring Boot + MySQL) on GKE.  
Kubernetes is container orchestration tool. GKE is a managed service that abstracts kubernetes so that even beginners of infrastructure can easily operate.  
It helps you understand the approach of building a basic application consisting of a web server, application server, and database in a container and deploying it to a GKE environment.

## How to hands on

### Local Development

You have to install Docker and Docker Compose on your local computer.  
cf. My Local Computer(MacBook Pro): Docker version 19.03.2, docker-compose version 1.24.1  
Maybe, it takes a long time to `mvn install` in build stage of Dockerfile.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/yellow-high5/easy-mvc-gke.git
$ cd easy-mvc-gke
$ docker-compose build
$ docker-compose up
```

### Google Kubernetes Engine

You need Google Cloud Platform Account.  
ðŸ‘‰You need checking Kubernets Engine API and Service Networking API is enabled  
cf. My GKE Version: 1.13.11-gke.14

```sh
# On your Google Cloud Shell
$ gcloud config set project [YOUR_PROJECT_ID]
$ git clone https://github.com/yellow-high5/easy-mvc-gke.git
$ cd easy-mvc-gke
$ chmod 700 ./production-gke-exe
$ sh production-gke-exe $(gcloud config get-value project)
```

### If it works correctly...

If you can access localhost or public ip on GKE Service, you should see the following screen.

"No data available" maybe signs you have no data or you cannot connect in your CloudSQL MySQL DB correctly.
